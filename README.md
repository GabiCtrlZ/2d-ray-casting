# 2D Ray Casting

2D Ray Casting, no libraries, written in TypeScript.

## Why Ray casting?

For a while, I've been fascinated with mathematics and physics in computer science and specifically in game engines, ray tracing is merely the first step in uncovering the word of game engine physics. Expect more to come soon

## App usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabiCtrlZ/2d-ray-casting.git

compile the TypeScript
```bash

and open `index.html`! simple!
